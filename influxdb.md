SELECT * FROM temps ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 30

-- List the latest 30 readings from the Derrick Wall:
SELECT * AS readable_time FROM temps WHERE location = 'derrickWallEnclTemp' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 30

-- List the first temp from each day for the last 30 days:
SELECT FIRST("temp") AS first_temp_of_day FROM "temps" WHERE time >= now() - 30d GROUP BY time(1d)

-- Show counts from countable columns:
SELECT count(*) FROM temps

-- List series limit to 5 rows:
SHOW SERIES LIMIT 5

### Backup/restore InfluxDB

InfluxDB 1.x

Source

```shell
# Check for the USB drive.
# It will probably be sda/sda1 with filesystem type vfat.
lsblk -f

# Mount it. Create /mnt/usb if it doesn't exist.
# sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb

# On the source
influxd backup -portable /path/to/backup

# Unmount the usb drive
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

Destination

```shell
# Move the usb drive to the new host and mount it as above.

# On the target
influxd restore -portable /path/to/backup

# Unmount the usb drive
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```
